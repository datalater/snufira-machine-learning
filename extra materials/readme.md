### ch.1

+ We're focusing on handwriting recognition because it's an excellent prototype problem for learning about neural networks in general.

+ we'll develop many key ideas about neural networks, including two important types of artificial neuron (the perceptron and the sigmoid neuron), and the standard learning algorithm for neural networks, known as stochastic gradient descent.

+ Throughout, I focus on explaining why things are done the way they are, and on building your neural networks intuition.

#### Perceptrons

+ to understand why sigmoid neurons are defined the way they are, it's worth taking the time to first understand perceptrons.
